Quasiquoter to define anonymous functions that can reference function
parameters by their number.

>>> :t [$holes| %1 + %2 |]
[$holes| %1 + %2 |] :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a

* Only numbers 1 through 9 can be used to reference function parameters.
* Number of parameters that generated function takes is determined by the
  maximum parameter number that is referenced in the function body.
* If '%' is used insided function body it should be surrounded by spaces to
  avoid substitution (in case it's followed by some number).
